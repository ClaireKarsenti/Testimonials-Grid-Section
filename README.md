## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I choose to do this simple project to experiment with SASS for the first time. This project was also perfect to deepen my knowledge in CSS Grid.

Here are some of my customizations:
- :star2: I added some entrance animations, different for each device to be full responsive.
- :iphone: To work more on the responsive aspect of this project I added a [tablet version](#tablet-version). 

### Useful resource

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9rBBbga8ws&t=266s) - This allowed me to be more familiar and to learn the basics of Sass.
- [Resource 2](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4) - This helped me to structure my Sass project.
